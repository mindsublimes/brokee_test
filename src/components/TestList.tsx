                    At the core of our payment system is the <b>credit model</b>. Users

                    Test credits indicate how many hiring candidates can take skills

                    Plan and go over your credit limit, candidates can still continue
                    taking skills assessments - you will be charged for the extra usage
                    at the end of the month based on a tiered pricing model (the more
                    tests that are used in a month, the cheaper they get).

                    We wanted to mirror the natural hiring process when designing our

                    interview, but only some of them will show up.

                    This way, we charge customers based on the skills assessments that
                    were started by candidates, not based on the number of invitations
                    you send.

                    When you're a small startup, one admin user might be enough for a

                    teams, you'll want to be able to provide access to multiple
                    teammates. This is why we added basic team management to our paid
